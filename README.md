**Project name:**
JSON Earthquake Analysis

**Project Description:** 
The earthquakes are one of the natural catastrophies happening around the world mainly in the regions of contact of the tectonic plates. Their movement results in 
sudden release of energy in earth's lithosphere, where seismic waves are created. These waves bring destruction to the earth's surface in different scales, depending on 
the magnitude of the earthquake itself, sometimes even causing another catastrophies as a result of the chain reaction. This project aims to analyze the past 30 days 
registered seismic data and plot the findings in order to understand the topic into more depth.
The raw data in form of JSON file was extracted from the current source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php


**Project Overview:** 
1. Import Libraries
2. Import JSON data and load to DataFrame
3. Plotting Data
3.1. Plot the earthquake data on the world map
3.2. Analyze how the earthquakes are distributed per magnitude category
3.3. Analyze the magnitude distribution based on other issues caused by earthquake
3.4. What are the top 15 most seismically active regions by frequency and what is the distribution of earthquake magnitudes?


**Libraries used:**
* json
* pandas
* plotly
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* joypy
